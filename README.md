This is the **second website** I built for my portfolio. Designed for an educative institution that holds young students from Chivilcoy. This was my **first approach** to Bootstrap 5.0. All of the content was manually developed with HTML, CSS + Bootstrap 5.0 and JS vanilla and was a challenge for myself to prove and implement the knowledge I adquired at that point of my learning process to being a Software Developer. Manually designed and coded, using "Mobile First" ideas to create this responsive page.
